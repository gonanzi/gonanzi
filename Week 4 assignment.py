#Question 1. File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è: Create a program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.
def modify_content(content):
    # Example modification: Convert the content to uppercase
    return content.upper()

def process_files(input_filename, output_filename):
    # Open the input file in read mode
    with open(input_filename, "r") as infile:
        content = infile.read()  # Read the entire content of the file
    
    # Modify the content (you can change this to any modification you need)
    modified_content = modify_content(content)
    
    # Open the output file in write mode
    with open(output_filename, "w") as outfile:
        outfile.write(modified_content)  # Write the modified content to the new file

    print(f"Content from '{input_filename}' has been modified and written to '{output_filename}'.")

# Example usage:
input_filename = "input.txt"  
output_filename = "output.txt"  

process_files(input_filename, output_filename)



#Question 2. Error Handling Lab üß™: Ask the user for a filename and handle errors if it doesn‚Äôt exist or can‚Äôt be read

        # Handle case when the file does not exist
        print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' does not exist.")
    except PermissionError:
        # Handle case when there are permission issues (e.g., file is read-only)
        print(f"Error: You do not have permission to read '{filename}'.")
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch any other exceptions and print the error
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
